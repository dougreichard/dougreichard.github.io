<h2 id="nibble">Nibble</h2>
<p>Nibble is a black jack style game with differences based on this style deck.</p>
<p>You must stay at 20 or below, and you must have more than the dealer to win.</p>
<p>The risk is much higher the more cards you have since the castles effect the score the more cards you get.</p>
<p>Also, your cost can increase the more cards the dealer gets.</p>
<p>However the reward is greater the more cards you get.</p>
<h2 id="gates">Gates</h2>
<p>Uses the logic gate icons to create an interesting twist on Baccarat.</p>
<p>The logic gates are used to calculate score rather than adding cards together.</p>
